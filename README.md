# AntiCrash
 Restart IPRoyal when it crashes

# Installation
 Make sure you have Python/Pip installed 
 then open a command promt/Terminal and type "pip install psutil" and "pip install infi.systray"
 then just run "main.pyw" and if you would like to see the console just remove the w from the file extension
 if you need any help DM me on discord or @ me in the IPRoyal discord: merwie#6574
